1) create two files - student.txt and employee.txt and add them to staging are

2) add one more file - dept.txt into staging area but at same time restore the employee.txt and modify some changes inside the student.txt 

3) push dept.txt, student.txt and employee.txt to the remote repos

4) create a new file - hello.txt in remote repos directly and bring to the working directory

5) send all files from working directory to remote repos

6) remove a file from the remote repos and sync the changes into your working directory



Solution :

# create student.txt and employee.txt

git add student.txt employee.txt
git commit -m "Added student and employee files"
